# WhatBlockTimeIsThat

A short script to guess the blockheight to be reached on a certain date at a
certain time in a certain timezone

In response to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/allenf32/status/1369728315637051402) where
@allenf32 asks "great idea for a website for anybody who can do this coding
shit all the cool kids are into:
  http://WhatBlockTimeIsThat.info
you put in your date, time, and timezone and it tells you the best guess as
to the block height."
